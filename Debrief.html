<h1>Kristina Ketola Bore said: "critique is about contextualization and understanding things in a historical perspective as well as in a contemporary one, it is about seeing something as existing outside of the objects frame, but as part of a society." Based on this I want to ask:<br><br>
How can the way a design or an object is contextualized alter it's values and meaning? By creating a series of works in different mediums the aim is to explore this. The series of studies in contextualization will be light hearted, or shallow, but through the element of curation the final presentation will be put into a narration about the meaning of value in graphic design.<br><br>
I would like the project to have elements that are both mundane and serious. Research projects can be shallow and the collection together will appear more content based (deep). With this project I want to use "shallow" visual explorations to understand how value and meaning can be affected by the context they are placed in.<br><br>
At first look it will be an installation of various projects, or studies, presented as a cabinet of curiosity. While at second glance they will be curated, put together, perhaps, with other objects or work that will narrate the theme: values and meaning in graphic design. Aiming to focus on the importance of context in graphic design. In this manner the project will be for both those who are not previously as interested in graphic design, as well as people with knowledge of, or within the field itself.
<br><br>
I imagine the presentation to be a collection of work, both made by me and a collection of objects that relate to the topic I am working with. I like to work with quantity, so I want my final project to be built up by multiple smaller projects.
