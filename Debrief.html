<h1>Kristina Ketola Bore said: "critique is about contextualization and understanding things in a historical perspective as well as in a contemporary one, it is about seeing something as existing outside of the objects frame, but as part of a society." Based on this I want to ask:<br><br>
How can the way a design or an object is contextualized alter it's values and meaning? By creating a series of works in different mediums the aim is to explore this. The series of studies in contextualization will be light hearted, or shallow, but through the element of curation the final presentation will be put into a narration about the meaning of value in graphic design.<br><br>
I would like the project to have elements that are both mundane and serious. Research projects can be shallow and the collection together will appear more content based (deep). With this project I want to use "shallow" visual explorations to understand how value and meaning can be affected by the context they are placed in.<br><br>
At first look it will be an installation of various projects, or studies, presented as a cabinet of curiosity. While at second glance they will be curated, put together, perhaps, with other objects or work that will narrate the theme: values and meaning in graphic design. Aiming to focus on the importance of context in graphic design. In this manner the project will be for both those who are not previously as interested in graphic design, as well as people with knowledge of, or within the field itself.
<br><br>
I imagine the presentation to be a collection of work, both made by me and a collection of objects that relate to the topic I am working with. I like to work with quantity, so I want my final project to be built up by multiple smaller projects.

"The content and effectiveness of communication have become strongly context-dependent, not least because the audience with whom the message communicates has itself matured"<br>– Max Bruinsma, 1999<br><br>
"The context influences your message"<br>– Cox & Grusenmeyer<br><br>
"To explore the role of design in relation to the public and political discourse through experimental visual design"<br>– Sandberg Institute<br><br>
George Orwell thought that to write against something gave his work more value, more of a purpose.<br><br>
What is the source material. What is the content.
Describe the sources you use. Critique can be a source.
Keep being vague, but explain.
Clear but open.
Test to make a statement.
Speculative.
Can I make a statement about value?
Take more into sccount what is already being said, but it is a fuller project.

In 1934, the German critic Walter Benjamin wrote “The Author as Producer,” a text that attacked the conventional view of authorship as a purely literary enterprise. He exclaimed that new forms of communication–film, radio, advertising, newspapers, the illustrated press–were melting down traditional artistic genres and corroding the borders between writing and reading, authoring and editing.
<br><br>
Benjamin attacked the model of the writer as an “expert” in the field of literary form, equipped only to craft words into texts and not to question the physical life of the work. The producer must ask, Where will the work be read? Who will read it? How will it be manufactured? What other texts and pictures will surround it? Benjamin argued that artists and photographers must not view their task as solely visual, lest they become mere suppliers of form to the existing apparatus of bourgeois publishing: “What we require of the photographer is the ability to give his picture the caption that wrenches it from modish commerce and gives it a revolutionary useful value. But we shall make this demand most emphatically when we–the writers–take up photography. Here, too, therefore, technical progress is for the author as producer the foundation of political progress”
<br><br>
The challenge for educators today is to help designers become the masters, not the slaves, of technology. There exist oportunities to seize control–intellectually and economically–of the means of production, and to share that control with the reading public, empowering them to become producers as well as consumers of meaning. As Benjamin phrased it in 1934, the goal is to turn “readers or spectators into collaborators”
<br><br>
How can schools help students along such a path at this critical juncture in our history?
<br><br>
*Language is a raw material.* Enhance students’ verbal literacy, giving them the confidence to work with and as editors, without forcing them to become writers.
<br><br>
*Theory is a practice.* Foster literacy by integrating the humanities into the studio. Infuse the act of making with the act of thinking.
<br><br>
*Writing is a tool.* Casual writing experiences encourage students to use writing as a device for “prototyping,” to be employed alongside sketching, diagramming, and other forms of conceptualization.
<br><br>
*Technology is physical.* Whether the product of our work is printed on paper or emitted from a screen, designers deal with the human, material response to information.
<br><br>
*The medium is on the menu.* Familiarize students with the many ways that information and ideas are disseminated in contemporary life. Give them the tools to find their rightful place in the food chain.
