Graphic design is constantly searching for new ways of expression, new medias to work within, new styles and new trends. Looking for confirmation from the society as well as within the field. What is lacking is the public dialogue, or reflection upon this topic in public media.
<br><br>
One reason reflection, or criticism, of graphic design is lacking in public media can be that there is no set definition of how to judge graphic design. The way we judge something is based on values, both personal and cultural, based on religion and history, surroundings and upbringing, backgrounds and interests. Which means there will always be potential for disagreement on how to judge graphic design, because the basis, our values, are inherently different.
<br><br><br><br>
Context.
<br><br>
The thesis was a research into why there is an apparent lack of graphic design in Norwegian media, but could as well be asking the same question on a more international level. One of the potential explanations was that there needs to be made room for disagreement, for a variation of values, in the public dialogue. Where disagreement is also a positive add to the development of the dialogue.
<br><br>
This realisation raised the questions:
What do values mean?
How does value affect how we judge?
How can different values coexist in one cohesive visual and written dialogue?
What does the context of a presented design object do to the value and/or meaning of a project?
How to connect values to graphic design?
<br><br><br><br>
Question.
<br><br>
How to explore the meaning of value through graphic design?
<br><br><br><br>
Content.
<br><br>
The content will based on a visual research into contradictions of value. It will be based contradicting values both on a personal level (such as the video example of Donald Trump) and on a more zoomed out society based level (religion, politics and so on)
<br><br><br><br>
Assignment.
<br><br>
V1. Explore what values are and can be through a series of smaller projects. Look for connections to how we analyse and what we expect in design objects? What are symbols of values? To avoid getting lost in content I will work mainly with juxtaposing opposites or contradicting values. Perhaps with a sense of humour, depending on the content.
<br><br>
Doing this I want to work with various media such as film, collages, 3d, print and installation to speculate in how value affects our judgement.
<br><br>
V2. Curate an installation where this research is visually describing my findings about values and expectations. Put together the individual objects will be able to comment on the system of values in relation to how we judge, perhaps draw a line to judging graphic design.
<br><br>
V3. Pre exhibit this installation, document and see what kind of dialogue I can make by presenting this. This stage is not yet planned out properly.
